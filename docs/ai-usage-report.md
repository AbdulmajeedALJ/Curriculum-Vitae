# AI Usage Report

## Where AI Helped
- Structure: scaffolded semantic HTML for About, Projects, Contact; ensured accessibility attributes.
- Styling: designed dark “galaxy” theme and light “sky with clouds”, responsive Grid/Flex layout.
- Interactivity: implemented theme toggle with persistence, greeting by time of day, and form validation.
- Debugging: resolved theme default/flash issues, button gradient coverage, and nav spacing.
- Content: refined project descriptions (FaceLite, ResumeIQ, MubarakBot) per user guidance.

## How AI Was Used Responsibly
- Kept control of design decisions, reviewed and edited AI suggestions.
- Ensured no external data/services were used for the contact form (privacy-safe demo).
- Verified cross‑browser friendly CSS/JS; avoided heavy frameworks.

## Understanding and Adaptation
- Adopted AI proposals selectively; adjusted CSS variables, media queries, and JS logic to meet requirements.
- Reverted/edited styles when user preferences changed (button gradient, spacing).

## Innovation
- Created distinct dual themes (galaxy vs. sky) with lightweight data‑URI artwork.
- Used inline SVG placeholders to avoid external assets while keeping a branded look.

## Limitations
- Contact form is demo-only; no backend.
- Placeholder images should be replaced by real screenshots for production.

## Next Steps
- Add project links, tech badges, and deployment.
- Add basic unit tests for JS utilities if expanded.
